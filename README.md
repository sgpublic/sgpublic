### Hi there üëã

I am an open source enthusiast who strives to become a full-stack programmer.

I created or joined the following organizations:
+ [@sgpublic-forks](https://github.com/sgpublic-forks): A repository for archiving all my forks for pull requests.
+ [@SuyhanStudio](https://github.com/SuyhanStudio): This is an organization that collects all the projects I created for my alma mater.
+ [@driveindex](https://github.com/driveindex): DriveIndex project organization, a OneDrive directory listing tool.
+ [@OpenMystere](https://github.com/OpenMystere): Mystere project organization, a headless robot client based on the official API of instant messaging software that implements the OneBot V11/V12 protocol.
+ [@opennaslab](https://github.com/opennaslab): A laboratory dedicated to developing tools for Network Attached Storage (NAS).

I have/am using the following technologies/languages (in order of proficiency):

+ Android/Kotlin
+ Kotlin Multiplatform/Compose Multiplatform
+ SpringBoot/Java
+ React/TypeScript
+ NoneBot/Python
+ GoLang

Since I have created so many repositories, not all of them can be actively maintained. Generally, I only actively maintain the repositories I am using, but as long as the repository is not archived, it means that I am willing to continue to maintain it. You can submit a bug or feature request in the issue, or simply click a star to let me know that someone wants the repository to continue to be updated.

You can also join my channel and ask me for updates directly:

+ QQ group: [Áé©Êú∫‰ø±‰πêÈÉ®](https://qm.qq.com/q/BVOI62wwdW)
+ QQ guild: [Êº´Â±ïÁ†¥‰∫ßÂÖÑË¥µ](https://pd.qq.com/s/yynbipji)

If my repository is helpful to you, you can buy me a cup of coffee at [Áà±ÂèëÁîµ](https://afdian.com/a/sgpublic) to give me more motivation to move forward!
